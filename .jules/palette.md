## 2024-05-22 - [The Value of Reset Actions]
**Learning:** In text-heavy input fields (like batch URL lists), users often make mistakes or want to restart. A simple "Clear" button reduces the friction of manually selecting and deleting text, providing a "delightful" micro-interaction that feels responsive to user intent.
**Action:** Look for other multi-line text inputs or complex form sections where a "Reset" or "Clear" action would simplify the error recovery flow.
