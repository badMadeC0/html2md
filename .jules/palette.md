## 2024-05-22 - Desktop GUI Mnemonics and Shortcuts
**Learning:** In desktop GUIs (like WPF), keyboard users rely heavily on mnemonics (Alt+Key) and tab order. Adding explicit "Paste" and "Clear" buttons significantly improves usability for mouse users, while careful mnemonic selection (e.g., `Clea_r` to avoid conflict with `_Convert`) ensures keyboard efficiency isn't compromised.
**Action:** Always map shortcuts for primary actions and check for conflicts in the visual label.
