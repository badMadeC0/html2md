# Palette's Journal - Critical Learnings

This journal records CRITICAL UX/accessibility learnings.
Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]`
**Learning:** [UX/a11y insight]
**Action:** [How to apply next time]

## 2024-05-23 - Semantic Status Colors
**Learning:** Users missed the failure count in the status text when it remained gray. Changing the status color to "Red" for errors and "DarkGreen" for success made the outcome immediately obvious without reading.
**Action:** Always couple text status messages with semantic color changes for primary actions.
